# Python Essentials

How it all Started

Let’s take a brief look into the history of Python shall we. 
        <ul>
            <li>1991 : von Rossum publishes Python version 0.9.0 to alt.sources</li>
            <li>1994 : Release of Python 1.0 , including functional programming</li>
            <li>2000 : Python 2.0 introduces list comprehension and garbage collection</li>
            <li>2008 : Python 3.0 released, fixes design flaws and is not backwards compatible
            <li>2020 : Last version of Python 2, version 2.7.18 released</li>
        </ul> 
        Python was designed to be a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that emphasized code readability and simplicity. It quickly gained popularity among developers due to its clear and concise syntax, as well as its wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more.

How its going

Ever wondered how Python got it’s name? Its a funny story actually. When its creator Guido von Rossum,began implementing Python, he was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.

### A Quick Overview of Python

There are two main ways one can code in Python
        <ol>
        <li>Interactive Mode </li> 
                <ul>
                        <li>Here, when we type the Python Statement, interpreter displays the result immediately.</li>
                        <li>Convenenient for begginers as they can test their codes immediately.</li>
                </ul>
        <li>Script Mode</li>
        <ul>
                        <li>Here, we type Python program in a file and then use interpreter to execute the content of the file </li>
                        <li>Required when one needs to write long pieces of code</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
 
 Variables in Python : These are used to store data and consist of 3 main parts
        <ul>
        <li>An Identity :  This is the name of the variable</li> 
        <li>Data Type : This is basically a set of permitted values and valid operations on those values.
                        There are 5 differnt data types in Python</li>
            <ol>
                 <li>Numbers : These consist of the different Numerical Values. They are further classified as</li>
                 <ul>
                        <li>Integer & Long : These are the whole numbers, ie decimal digits without the fraction part</li>
                        <li>Float : These are the with a fraction part</li>
                        <li>Complex : These are used to store numbers with real and imaginary part</li>
                 </ul>
                 <li>None : This is special data type with a single value. It is used to signify the absence of value/false in a situation. It is represented by None.</li>
                 <li>Sequence : A sequence is an ordered collection of items, indexed by positive integers. They are of the follwoing types</li>
                 <ul>
                        <li>String- is an ordered sequence of letters/characters. They are enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). They are immutable, ie they cannot be edited after creation</li>
                        <li>Lists: List is also a sequence of values of any type. Values in the list are called elements / items. These are mutable and indexed/ordered. List is enclosed in square brackets ([]).</li> 
                        <li>Tuples: Tuples are a sequence of values of any type and are indexed by integers. They are immutable. Tuples are enclosed in ().</li>
                 </ul>
                 <li>Sets : This is an unordered collection of values of any type with no duplicate entry. It is immutable.</li>
                 <li>Mapping : This data type is unordered and mutable.</li>
                 <ul>
                 <li>Dictionaries, which are made up of key value pairs are an example. They are enclosed in curly brackets ({})</li>
                 </ul> 
            </ol>
            <li>Value :  This is any number, letter or string that can be assigned to a variable using the assigment operator (=)</li> 
        </ul>
