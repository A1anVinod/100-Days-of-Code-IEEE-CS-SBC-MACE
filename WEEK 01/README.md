# Python Essentials

How it all Started

Let’s take a brief look into the history of Python shall we. 
        <ul>
            <li>1991 : von Rossum publishes Python version 0.9.0 to alt.sources</li>
            <li>1994 : Release of Python 1.0 , including functional programming</li>
            <li>2000 : Python 2.0 introduces list comprehension and garbage collection</li>
            <li>2008 : Python 3.0 released, fixes design flaws and is not backwards compatible
            <li>2020 : Last version of Python 2, version 2.7.18 released</li>
        </ul> 
        Python was designed to be a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that emphasized code readability and simplicity. It quickly gained popularity among developers due to its clear and concise syntax, as well as its wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more.

How its going

Ever wondered how Python got it’s name? Its a funny story actually. When its creator Guido von Rossum,began implementing Python, he was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.

<h3>Task #1</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p align="justify">You are required to replace every letter with its position in the alphabet, given a string. If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it. "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

                Example

                Input    ("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

                Output   "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )</p></li>
